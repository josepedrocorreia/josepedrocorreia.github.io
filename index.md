# About me

My name is José Pedro Correia and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Porto, working as part of the [Mind, Language, and Action Group](https://mlag.up.pt/). My work is funded by [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia](http://www.fct.pt/) (grant number SFRH/BD/100437/2014).

In my thesis, I explore the connections between signaling games and the later philosophy of language of Ludwig Wittgenstein (focusing on the _Philosophical Investigations_). My broader interests include vagueness, Richard Rorty's pragmatism, and artificial intelligence (of the connectionist kind).

The topic of my PhD thesis stems from my studies at the University of Amsterdam for the [Master of Logic](http://www.illc.uva.nl/MScLogic/) programme (2011-2013). There, I began developing an interest in better understanding meaning in natural language. Unsatisfied with formal semantics and related logic-based approaches, I became interested in signaling games as an alternative framework for conceptualizing meaning. My thesis, which you can find [here](http://arno.uva.nl/document/499282), investigates the application of signaling games to the philosophical problem of vagueness.

In a past life, I studied Software Engineering at the University of Minho (2002-2007) in Braga, my hometown. That included an internship on video processing at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home.html) in Eindhoven. After that, I moved to Amsterdam and worked as a researcher at the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.sig.eu/). I also worked as a software quality assurance engineer, first at [Textkernel](https://www.textkernel.com/) and then, after moving back to Portugal, at [Blip](https://blip.pt/).
