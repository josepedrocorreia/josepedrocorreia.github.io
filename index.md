# About me

My name is José Pedro Correia and I am currently a data scientist and the head of IT at [Centro de Medicina Digital P5](https://www.p5.pt/). 

I studied Software Engineering at the University of Minho (2002-2007) in Braga, my hometown. That included an internship on video processing at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home.html) in Eindhoven. After that, I moved to Amsterdam and worked as a researcher/data scientist at [Software Improvement Group](https://www.sig.eu/). I also worked as a software quality assurance engineer, first at [Textkernel](https://www.textkernel.com/) and then, after moving back to Portugal, at [Blip](https://blip.pt/).

During my period in the Netherlands, I completed the [Master of Logic](http://www.illc.uva.nl/MScLogic/) programme (2011-2013) at the University of Amsterdam. There, I began developing an interest in better understanding meaning in natural language. Unsatisfied with formal semantics and related logic-based approaches, I became interested in signaling games as an alternative framework for conceptualizing meaning. For [my MSc thesis](http://arno.uva.nl/document/499282), I investigated the application of signaling games to the philosophical problem of vagueness.

This led to a PhD programme (2015-2019) at the University of Porto, working as part of the [Mind, Language, and Action Group](https://mlag.up.pt/). My work was funded by [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia](http://www.fct.pt/) (grant number SFRH/BD/100437/2014). In [my PhD thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/10216/126715), I explore the connections between signaling games and the later philosophy of language of Ludwig Wittgenstein (focusing on the _Philosophical Investigations_). My broader interests in philosophy include vagueness, Richard Rorty's pragmatism, and artificial intelligence (of the connectionist kind).

After finishing my PhD, I decided to return to the IT world, having worked as a data scientist at [Uphold](https://uphold.com/), before moving to my current position.
