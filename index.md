# About me

My name is José Pedro Correia and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Porto, working as part of the [Mind, Language, and Action Group](https://mlag.up.pt/).

I studied Software Engineering at the University of Minho (2002-2007) in Braga, my hometown. That included an internship on video processing at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home.html) in Eindhoven. After that, I moved to Amsterdam and worked as a researcher at the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.sig.eu/), and later as a software quality assurance engineer, first at [Textkernel](https://www.textkernel.com/) and then, after moving back to Portugal, at [Blip](https://blip.pt/).

In 2011, I enrolled in the [Master of Logic](http://www.illc.uva.nl/MScLogic/) at the University of Amsterdam and there began developing an interest in better understanding meaning in natural language. Unsatisfied with formal semantics and related logic-based approaches, I became interested in signaling games as an alternative framework for conceptualizing meaning. My thesis, which you can find [here](http://arno.uva.nl/document/499282), investigates the application of signaling games to the philosophical problem of vagueness.

I am currently working on a PhD thesis about the connection between signaling games and the later philosophy of language of Ludwig Wittgenstein (focusing on the _Philosophical Investigations_). My broader interests include vagueness, Richard Rorty's pragmatism, and artificial intelligence.
